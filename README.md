## project info
In this School project I was creating a space shooter uning the [MonoGame](https://monogame.net/) framework and C#. I had most of my focus on creating a "game engine" based on elements I did enjoy about Unity, since I knew that this was a future assignment and it'd be helpful to have already dabbled in making such a thing.

## abandoned
I have abandoned this project due to me being unsatisfied with how I went about it. Firstly, I focuessed more on writing a "game engine" than actually coding, causing the project to be bloated. I didn't know what was going on anymore and the project ran dry.
